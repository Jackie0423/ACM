 Problem A.Ant on a Chessboard 
 
Background

  One day, an ant called Alice came to an M*M chessboard. She wanted to go around all the grids. So she began to walk along the chessboard according to this way: (you can assume that her speed is one grid per second)
  At the first second, Alice was standing at (1,1). Firstly she went up for a grid, then a grid to the right, a grid downward. After that, she went a grid to the right, then two grids upward, and then two grids to the left¡­in a word, the path was like a snake.
  For example, her first 25 seconds went like this:
  ( the numbers in the grids stands for the time when she went into the grids)
                .
                .
25 24  23 22 21 5
10 11  12 13 20 4
9  8   7  14 19 3
2  3   6  15 18 2
1  4   5  16 17 1
1  2   3  4  5 .... 
 
1          2          3           4           5
At the 8th second , she was at (2,3), and at 20th second, she was at (5,4).
Your task is to decide where she was at a given time.
(you can assume that M is large enough)
 
 
Input

  Input file will contain several lines, and each line contains a number N(1<=N<=2*10^9), which stands for the time. The file will be ended with a line that contains a number 0.
 
 
Output

  For each input situation you should print a line with two numbers (x, y), the column and the row number, there must be only a space between them.
